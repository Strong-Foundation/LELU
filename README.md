# LELU
Data contained within Legal Aid Society's Law Enforcement Lookup (LELU)

https://legalaidnyc.org/law-enforcement-look-up/

Folders contain raw tsv and yml files corresponding to each tab of LELU.

See 'About' Section of each LELU tab for information on the origins of the data. 

This repository is updated each time LELU is updated. 

The primary purpose of this database is to support NYC LAS attorneys in representing their clients, and we share this information with the public as a courtesy. LAS does not have the organizational capacity to support full-stack application development and we are therefore limited in our ability to provide documentation or updates, make improvements, or collaborate with outside parties.
